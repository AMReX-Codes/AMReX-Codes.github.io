            Dimethyl Ether (DME) is a promising alternative fuel in the industry, 
            especially for diesel engines and gas turbines, because it can be produced 
            from biomass and has interesting properties in terms of low emission of 
            pollutants. Consequently, there is a need to understand how this fuel behave 
            in the context of turbulent combustion in realistic engine operation 
            conditions. Experimental observations are unable to provide enough 
            details about all the chemical reactions and their interactions with the 
            turbulent flow. Computational Fluid Dynamics of reacting flows is a good 
            candidate to have access to such data, but detailed numerical simulations 
            come at a high computational cost and must rely on accurate numerical 
            methods. <p><p>

              Most CFD codes are not designed to tackle such simulations: some are 
              based on low-order methods that provide inaccurate results; some 
              others implement high-order numerical methods but are 
              unable to deal with the highly stiff chemistry of fuels 
              like DME in the context of turbulent flows, leading in 
              practice to very slow and unpractical simulations time. 
              This has motivated the CCSE team to develop the RNS software. 
              The code solves the compressible reactive Navier-Stokes 
              equations with detailed models for the chemistry. A 
              novel time integration strategy has been developed and 
              is based on the Multi-Level Spectral Deferred Correction 
              method, but extended to an Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) 
              framework and employs an Implicit/Explicit (IMEX) treatment 
              suitable for combustion applications. Coupled with 
              finite-volume conservative WENO schemes, the RNS code provide 
              an overall fourth-order accuracy in both time and space for 
              all variables, while keeping the computational burden low. <p><p>

              The picture on the left presents an instantaneous snapshot of the
              temperature field of the Dimethyl Ether flame computed with 
              the RNS code. The simulation employs three levels of mesh 
              refinement, which are depicted with the grey and black boxes. <p><p>
