Small Volume Embedded Boundary Cells
====================================

First, we review finite volume discretizations with embedded boundaries as used by
AMReX-Hydro. Then we illustrate the small cell problem.

Finite Volume Discretizations
-----------------------------

Consider a system of PDEs to advance a conserved quantity :math:`U` with fluxes
:math:`F`:

.. math:: \frac{\partial U}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot F = 0.
  :label: eqn::hypsys

A conservative, finite volume discretization starts with the divergence theorm

.. math:: \int_V \nabla \cdot F dV = \int_{\partial V} F \cdot n dA.

In an embedded boundary cell, the "conservative divergence" is discretized (as
:math:`D^c(F)`) as follows

.. math::
  :label: eqn::ebdiv

   D^c(F) = \frac{1}{\kappa h} \left( \sum^D_{d = 1}
     (F_{d, \mathrm{hi}} \, \alpha_{d, \mathrm{hi}} - F_{d, \mathrm{lo}}\, \alpha_{d, \mathrm{lo}})
     + F^{EB} \alpha^{EB} \right).

Geometry is discretely represented by volumes (:math:`V = \kappa h^d`) and
apertures (:math:`A= \alpha h^{d-1}`), where :math:`h` is the (uniform) mesh
spacing at that AMR level, :math:`\kappa` is the volume fraction and
:math:`\alpha` are the area fractions. Without multivalued cells the volume
fractions, area fractions and cell and face centroids (see
:numref:`fig::volume`) are the only geometric information needed to compute
second-order fluxes centered at the face centroids, and to infer the
connectivity of the cells. Cells are connected if adjacent on the Cartesian
mesh, and only via coordinate-aligned faces on the mesh. If an aperture,
:math:`\alpha = 0`, between two cells, they are not directly connected to each
other.

Small Cells And Stability
-------------------------

In the context of time-explicit advance methods for, say hyperbolic
conservation laws, a naive discretization in time of :eq:`eqn::hypsys` using
:eq:`eqn::ebdiv`,

.. math:: U^{n+1} = U^{n} - \delta t D^c(F)

would have a time step constraint :math:`\delta t \sim h \kappa^{1/D}/V_m`,
which goes to zero as the size of the smallest volume fraction :math:`\kappa` in
the calculation. Since EB volume fractions can be arbitrarily small, this presents an
unacceptable constraint. This is the so-called "small cell problem," and AMReX-Hydro
addresses it with redistribution methods.
