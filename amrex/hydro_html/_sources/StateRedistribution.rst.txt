State Redistribution
====================

For state redistribution we implement the weighted state
redistribution algorithm as described in Guiliani et al (2021),
which is available on `arxiv  <https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12360>`_ .
This is an extension of the original state redistribution algorithm
of Berger and Guiliani (2020).
