# Welcome to AMReX Codes

AMReX is a software framework library containing all the functionality
to write massively parallel, block-structured adaptive mesh refinement
(AMR) applications.

AMReX is hosted at [https://github.com/AMReX-Codes/amrex](https://github.com/AMReX-Codes/amrex). A User's
Guide can be found at [here](AMReXUsersGuide.pdf), and a Doxygen page can be found at
