          <p>Proof-of-concept demonstrations of scalar transport between AMReX and MFEM domains</p>

            <h3>The Physical Problem</h3>
            <p>
            Consider a drop of dye with concentration $\phi$, passively advected by a fluid with prescribed motion. In each case shown below, $\phi$ is initialized using a cosine profile $\phi = 0.5(1 + \cos(\pi r/w))$ for $r < w$ and $\phi = 0$ otherwise, where $r$ is the distance from the blob center and $w = 0.2$ is the blob radius.

            <h3>The Solution Procedure</h3>
            <p>
            AMReX solves for $\phi(\mathbf{x},t)$ using an explicit finite volume approach on a 
            block-structured mesh that maintains 
            conservation of $\phi$ and is first-order accurate in time and second-order accurate in space.

            <p>
            MFEM solves for $\phi(\mathbf{x},t)$ using a discontinuous piecewise-cubic finite element
            approach on an unstructured mesh of quadrilateral elements with explicit third-order time 
            integration.

            <p>
            Each simulation uses multiple MPI processes and domain decomposition such that
            MPI processes are split between AMReX and MFEM with data 
            exchange occurring every time step at user-defined coupling regions.
            The frameworks communicate field values and coordinates through MPI 
            point-to-point messaging.

            <p>
            <h4>ParaView Visualization Capabilities</h4>
            ParaView supports both AMReX native plotfiles and MFEM-generated ParaView-ready output. 
            For coupled simulations, both outputs must be read separately but can be viewed together. 
            The reading can be facilitated through pvsm or python state scripts. These tools enable 
            automated animations in multiple formats (AVI, MP4, GIF) using pvpython with various 
            rendering backends.
            </p>

            <p>
            As part of the visualization capabilities in this work, we provide both Python state files and PVSM ParaView state files that can be used to quickly reproduce the plots and animations shown on this website. These state files can also be incorporated into debugging or analysis workflows to facilitate consistent visualization setups across different simulation runs and parameter studies. Additionally, we provide a Python state file demonstrating 
            multi-layout visualization capabilities for coupled MFEM-AMReX simulations. The script 
            creates three side-by-side render views: a complete surface representation using unified 
            Viridis colormap, contour analysis with multiple isosurface levels rendered as wireframe 
            overlays, and threshold analysis using layered opacity effects. All views are synchronized 
            for animation playback with consistent color mapping and camera positioning. For guidance on 
            using state files with ParaView, see the <a href="https://amrex-codes.github.io/amrex/docs_html/Visualization.html#saving-and-loading-state-files">saving and loading state files</a> subheading in the AMReX documentation.
            </p>

            <p>
            Visualization of AMReX results is facilitated by the write_series_file_timestamp.sh script, 
            which generates JSON-formatted .series files indexing plotfiles with timestamps. This follows 
            <a href="https://amrex-codes.github.io/amrex/docs_html/Visualization.html#creating-and-loading-series-files">AMReX documentation guidelines for time series files</a> that can be efficiently loaded into 
            ParaView or VisIt. The script can be re-executed as new plotfiles are generated, and 
            ParaView's "Reload Files" functionality enables seamless incorporation of new timesteps 
            during ongoing simulations.

            This 2D example demonstrates the AMReX-MFEM coupling for 
            scalar advection on a rectangular domain.

                This example was run with the overall amrex domain having 320 by 160 cells and mfem having 40 elements in x and 80 elements in y.

            <p>
            For this domain, we define a simple shearing flow where the flow moves                
            left to right in the lower half and right to left in the upper half (i.e. $u = ±1$ and $v = 0$).  
            The solution (aka the value of $\phi$) is computed by                   
            MFEM in the left half of the domain and by AMReX in the right half of the domain.    The domain is periodic in both 
            the $x$- and $y-$ directions.

            This 3D example extends the scalar advection demonstration to three dimensions,
            The same MPI domain decomposition approach is used, with processes split between 
            AMReX and MFEM frameworks (again with MFEM on the left).
            </p>

            <p>
            The velocity field is analogous to that in the 2D case, with $u = ±1$ depending on the y-coordinate and $v = w = 0$. 
            As above, the solution is computed by                   
            MFEM in the left half of the domain and by AMReX in the right half of the domain.

            This example demonstrates two additional features: first, the ability
            to have multiple AMReX subdomains and multiple MFEM subdomains with multiple planes of intersection
            in a single simulation, and second, the ability of MFEM to naturally support a non-rectangular geometry.
            </p>

            <!--p>

            </p-->

            <p>
            In this problem the flow is counter-clockwise and is parallel to the domain boundaries as they appear
            in the animation.  The flow in the semicircular regions is that of solid-body rotation.

            <!-- The curved geometry combined with the circular velocity field $\mathbf{u} = (-(y-3), (x-7))$ creates interesting rotational flow patterns. This proof-of-concept demonstrates how MFEM can handle complicated and interesting domain geometries while AMReX manages logically rectangular sections in between. -->

The racetrack example showcases the potential flexibility of the coupling framework for complex multiphysics problems requiring both structured and unstructured discretization approaches.

            to have multiple AMReX subdomains and multiple MFEM subdomains with multiple planes of intersection
            in a single simulation, and the ability of MFEM to naturally support complex non-rectangular geometries with varying vertical dimensions.
            </p>

            <p>
            The helix geometry features a variable height profile, with sections maintaining different elevations
            that create a banked track configuration. This showcases how the coupling framework can handle
            geometries with significant topographical variation.
            </p>

            <p>
            In this problem the flow follows the helical domain boundaries as they appear
            in the animation, with vertical flow components accommodating the height transitions. 
            The flow in the curved regions exhibits complex three-dimensional patterns due to the elevation changes.

            These examples demonstrate a proof-of-concept multiphysics coupling framework 
            that could be suitable for complex scientific computing applications requiring coordinated 
            block-structured and finite element methods. Key features include:<p><p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Dimensional flexibility:</strong> Support for 2D and 3D simulations with complex geometries</li>
              <li><strong>Complex geometries:</strong> Handling of irregular domains like the racetrack example</li>
              <li><strong>MPI domain decomposition:</strong> Process-level splitting between frameworks</li>
              <li><strong>Time-synchronized coupling:</strong> Real-time data exchange maintaining conservation across domain boundaries</li>
              <li><strong>Configurable regions:</strong> User-defined coupling areas through input parameters</li>
            </ul>

            The framework enables sophisticated multiphysics simulations that leverage the 
            strengths of both AMReX's adaptive mesh refinement capabilities and MFEM's 
            advanced finite element discretizations.
